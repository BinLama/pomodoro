#### RUN:

This is a React/Nodejs/Sequelize/MySQL/SCSS based Pomodoro Project. Feel free to clone it and use it for you own use.

- Running the server:

```bash

foo@bar: ~$ cd server
foo@bar/server: ~$ npm install && npm run dev
```

##### Server Notes:

- Be sure to provide any env variables needed. The env variables that I am using are as follows:

```
TEST_DB_USER
TEST_DB_PASSWORD
TEST_DB_DATABASE
TEST_DB_HOST
TEST_DB_PORT
JWT_SECRET
COOKIE_SECRET
```

You will need to provide atleast these variables for the server to run properly on your localhost.

Server uses port: 5000 and frontend uses port: 5173
